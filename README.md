Insulin and Blood Glucose tracking app.

Goal is to create a product/service/tool that enables Type1 Diabetics to understand how key variables affect their overall blood sugar levels. 

Users can determine a specific "Good Blood Sugar" range. Over time, the app records CGM readings and then displays fitness and health data that may have played a role in the "Good Blood Sugar" range. In addition, it will track the display for the opposite, "Bad Blood Sugar" range. 

Key points of app:

* Utilizing sandbox data - SandboxUser5

* G6 Mobile App
* Data exists from 2018-02-15 to 2018-04-15

* Using Ruby and Rails 

* Developing on Microsoft Surface Pro4 

* All devices - desktop, Android & IOs
