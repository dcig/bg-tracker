Blood Glucose trend anomoly identifier tool

Goal is to create a tool that enables Type1 Diabetics to understand how key variables affect their overall blood sugar levels. 

Users can determine a specific "Good Blood Sugar" range. Over time, the app records CGM readings and then displays fitness and health data that may have played a role in the "Good Blood Sugar" range. In addition, it will track the display for the opposite, "Bad Blood Sugar" range.
